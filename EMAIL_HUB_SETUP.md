# Business Evolution AI - Email Management Hub Setup Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

Your email management hub is now ready! To access it:

1. Make sure your Python server is running:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
   ```

## üìä Overview

This email management hub provides:
- **Subscriber Management**: View, search, and filter your email list from Google Sheets
- **Email Composition**: Create and send emails with templates and personalization
- **Export Functionality**: Export subscriber data to CSV
- **Settings Management**: Configure Google Sheets connection and email settings

## üîß Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Connect to Your Google Sheets

Your subscriber data is already being collected in Google Sheets. To connect the dashboard:

1. Go to the **Settings** tab in the dashboard
2. Find your Google Sheets ID from your spreadsheet URL:
   - Example URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEETS_ID/edit`
   - Copy the `YOUR_SHEETS_ID` part
3. Paste it in the "Google Sheets ID" field
4. Click "Test Connection"

### Step 2: Enable Google Sheets API (Optional - For Live Data)

Currently, the dashboard shows test data. To connect to live Google Sheets data:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable Google Sheets API
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Add the API key in Settings

**Note**: For now, the dashboard works great with test data, so this step is optional.

### Step 3: Email Sending Options

The dashboard supports multiple email sending methods:

#### Option 1: Gmail API (Recommended for Gmail users)
- Uses your Gmail account to send emails
- Maintains good deliverability
- Requires Google API setup

#### Option 2: Google Apps Script (Simple approach)
- Extend your existing Apps Script
- No additional API setup needed
- Limited to 100 emails/day for free accounts

#### Option 3: Email Service Provider (Professional approach)
- Services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES
- Better for high volume
- Requires account setup and API key
